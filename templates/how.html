	    <h3>What to bring to the recording</h3>
		<p>The voice artist should come to the recording with their scripts. These 
		scripts should have been properly rehearsed before recording day.</p>

		<p>Remember each voice clip requires a script. Apparently, if you are only 
		recording 2 clips then you only need 2 scripts.</p>

		<p><strong>The Nigerian Voice bank will not supply scripts!</strong></p>

		<p>All scripts are to be delivered within 60 seconds. Scripts should be original or 
		reworked, using fictitious brand names and company names. Voice artists should respect copyright laws.</p>

		<p><strong>The Nigerian Voice Bank will not take responsibility for any legal issues emanating from 
		content supplied by any artist.</strong></p>

		<p>Please ensure that you are prepared for the recording and that you have rehearsed your scripts!</p>

		<p>
		    If for any reason the Nigerian Voice Bank considers your voice clip not 
		    suitable or too inexperienced, the Nigerian voice bank reserves the right to decline 
		    your subscription. In this case your subscription fee will be refunded.
		</p>
	    </div>
	    <div class="tab_content" id="renewals">
		<h3>Renewals</h3>
		<p><strong>Subscription on the Nigerian Voice Bank is valid for 1 year from the day 
		your voice clip is uploaded to the website.</strong></p>

		<p>Notification will be sent to you periodically via email or SMS with instructions on 
		how to renew your subscription.</p>

		<p>If you fail to renew your subscription, you will receive an email on the expiry date 
		informing you that your subscription has expired. Your account will then be deleted from the website.</p>

		<p>The cost to renew your subscription for another year is just 1000 Naira. The renewal 
		fee allows you to keep your existing clips on the website for another year.</p>

		<p>If you would like to replace your existing clips that will be done for 1000 Naira per clip.</p>
