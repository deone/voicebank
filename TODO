Do:
* Page titles.
* Refactor forms, styles and URLs.
* Make error and success messges look nicer.
* Fix project name hardcoding in events templatetags.

* Use templatetags this way e.g. {% show_voiceclips user %} so that we won't need to pass voiceclip as context variable.
* Style musicbox comments list.
* Review current unit tests and write more.
* POST view tests are crass.
 - Unit-test for success or error messages.
 - Also, look out for other things to check in POST views.
 - We can now do error message checks in POST requests, courtesy Django 1.3.

Note these model/db changes:
* Category now contains slug field.
* vbank, events, booking, contact now standalone apps
 - core_event now events_event.
 - core_booking now booking_booking.
 - core_contact now contact_contact.
 - core_category and core_voiceclips now vbank_category and vbank_voiceclips.

Voiceclip templatetags
