Do:
* Paginate all voice clips and every other page.
* Also, ensure that events_context_var is available wherever required.
* Top 5 voice clips.
* Won't it be nicer to have a Profile -> VoiceClip ER rather than a User -> VoiceClip ER?
* POST view tests are crass.
 - Unit-test for success or error messages.
 - Also, look out for other things to check in POST views.


Improvements
- Use slugs for category homes - should read /categories/slug instead of /categories/id. Unit-test.
- Separate app-specific settings.
- REST - Django Piston.
- Generic views for create/update profile and voice clips functionality.

Design work to be paid for:
* Public Profile.
* "My Voice Clips" tab.
* Pagination.
* New clip design.
