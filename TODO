Do:
* Musicbox unit tests.
* Musicbox track plays - attach event handler to player.
* Page titles.
* Refactor forms, styles and URLs.
* Make error and success messges look nicer.

* Review current unit tests and write more.
* POST view tests are crass.
 - Unit-test for success or error messages.
 - Also, look out for other things to check in POST views.
 - We can now do error message checks in POST requests, courtesy Django 1.3.

- Ensure that we can only feature one article per article type at a time by unsetting the last featured article when a new one is featured.
