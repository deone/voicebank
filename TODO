Do:
* Review current unit tests and write more.
* POST view tests are crass.
 - Unit-test for success or error messages.
 - Also, look out for other things to check in POST views.
 - We can now do error message checks in POST requests, courtesy Django 1.3.

Note these model/db changes:
* Category now contains slug field.
* Events now standalone app - core_event now events_event.
* Booking now standalone app - core_booking now booking_booking.


Improvements
- Do we need a templatetag for voice clip lists?
- Refactor forms, styles and URLs.
- Style comments.
- Why do we need a link /home that points to core.urls?
- Generic views for create/update profile and voice clips functionality.

- Refactor core, split components into separate apps or use
  existing apps.
  Components are:
  * voicebank - core.
  * contact
