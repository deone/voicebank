Do:
* Provide initial data.
* Use slugs for category homes - should read /categories/slug instead of
/categories/id/voiceclips. Also unit-test this.
* Can't we use `slug` instead of `url_id` in UserProfileForm?
* Ensure that all forms display errors.
* Separate app-specific settings.
* Automate deployment.
* Fix user profile linking on home and categories page.
* Check event date before displaying 'em i.e don't display past events.
* Unit-test model ImageField.
* Specify content_type for file upload tests in core.
* Unit-testing for success or error messages is crucial to robust POST views tests because the response status_code is always 200.


Improvements
- REST - Django Piston.
- Generic views for create/update profile and voice clips functionality.
