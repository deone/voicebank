Do:
* Provide initial data.
* Use slugs for category homes - should read /categories/slug instead of
/categories/id/voiceclips. Also unit-test this.
* Can't we use `slug` instead of `url_id` in UserProfileForm?
* Fix user profile linking on home and categories page.
* POST view tests are crass.
 - Unit-test for success or error messages.
 - Also, look out for other things to check in POST views.


Improvements
- Separate app-specific settings.
- REST - Django Piston.
- Generic views for create/update profile and voice clips functionality.
