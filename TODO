Do:
* Provide initial data.
* Send email to user after registration.
* Use slugs for category homes - should read /categories/slug instead of
/categories/id/voiceclips.
* Can't we use `slug` instead of `url_id` in UserProfileForm?
* Ensure that all forms display errors.
* Make chosen work properly.
* Unit-test:
    - Profile model, accounts forms and views.
    - Core app.
* Separate app-specific settings.
* Automate deployment.
* Align form (success) messages properly.
* Fix user profile linking on home and categories page.



Improvements
- REST - Django Piston.
- Generic views for create/update profile and voice clips functionality.
