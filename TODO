Do:
* Find and use a robust yet simple audio player.
* Use slugs for category homes - should read /categories/slug instead of
/categories/id. Also unit-test this.
* POST view tests are crass.
 - Unit-test for success or error messages.
 - Also, look out for other things to check in POST views.


Improvements
- Separate app-specific settings.
- REST - Django Piston.
- Generic views for create/update profile and voice clips functionality.
