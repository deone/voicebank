Do:
* Find and use a robust yet simple audio player.
* Top 5 voice clips.
* Use slugs for category homes - should read /categories/slug instead of
/categories/id. Also unit-test this.
* POST view tests are crass.
 - Unit-test for success or error messages.
 - Also, look out for other things to check in POST views.
Unit-test:
 - Public profile.
 - /categories/{{id}}
 - /voiceclips


Improvements
- Separate app-specific settings.
- REST - Django Piston.
- Generic views for create/update profile and voice clips functionality.

Design work to be paid for:
* Public Profile.
* "My Voice Clips" tab.
