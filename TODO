Do:
* Use slugs for category homes - should read /categories/slug instead of
/categories/id/voiceclips
* Ensure that all forms display errors.
* Make chosen work properly.
* Unit-test:
    - Profile model, accounts forms and views.
    - Core app.
* Send email to user after registration.
* Separate app-specific settings.
* Clean url_id in such a way that it won't raise an error when a user uses his
  current url_id.
* Can't we use `slug` instead of `url_id` in UserProfileForm?

Milestone II
