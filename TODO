Do:
* Paginate all voice clips and every other page.
* Won't it be nicer to have a Profile -> VoiceClip ER rather than a User -> VoiceClip ER? Reasons??
* POST view tests are crass.
 - Unit-test for success or error messages.
 - Also, look out for other things to check in POST views.
 - We can now do error message checks in POST requests, courtesy Django 1.3.


Improvements
- Refactor forms, styles and URLs.
- Make templates DRY e.g. We can have one template for album_list.
- Why do we need a link /home that points to core.urls?
- Review current unit tests and write more.
- Use slugs for category homes - should read /categories/slug instead of /categories/id. Unit-test.
- Separate app-specific settings.
- Generic views for create/update profile and voice clips functionality.
- Refactor core, split components into separate apps or use
- Do template inheritance properly.
